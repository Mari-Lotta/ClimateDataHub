# Climate Data Aggregation and Analysis Hub

## Overview
This project aggregates, processes, and analyzes climate data, using Azure Synapse Analytics, Data Lake Storage, and Data Factory to provide insights into global temperature trends and other climate metrics. Data is ingested from public sources, transformed, and stored for analysis.

## Project Components
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Processes and analyzes climate data with serverless SQL and pipeline integration.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage**: Stores raw and processed climate data.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Manages data ingestion pipelines from external sources to Data Lake.

## Project Structure
- **Synapse**: Contains documentation and configurations for the Azure Synapse workspace.
- **DataLake**: Documentation for the Azure Data Lake Storage account.
- **DataFactory**: Configuration details for Azure Data Factory pipelines and linked services.

## Future Development
- Integrate with Power BI for climate data visualization.
- Add advanced predictive analytics models using Synapse ML.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Set Up Azure Resources**: Follow each service README to configure and link resources.
2. **Test Pipelines**: Run Data Factory pipelines to ensure data is ingested and stored in Data Lake.
3. **Analyze Data**: Use Synapse to perform SQL queries and transformations.
